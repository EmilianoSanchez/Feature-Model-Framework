# Feature-Model-Framework
A JAVA library for building and optimizing feature models (FMs).

The library includes:
  - Utils for building FMs.
  - An original algorithm called Configuration Selection Algorithm (CSA) for solving the FM optimization problem. 
  - A set of experiments for comparing CSA variants with alternative approaches, using synthetic and real models.

## Running the experiments

This chapter describes the steps to get started and run the experiments.

1. Install the Java Development Kit 8 or higher.
2. Download the project from Github.
```sh
$ git clone git://github.com/EmilianoSanchez/Feature-Model-Framework.git
```
    
3. Unzip files at **Models** subfolder: 
   - `Models/SPLOT-models/SPLOT-models.zip`
   - `Models/Thor-attributes-Sample1/Thor-attributes-Sample1.zip`
   - `Models/Thor-attributes-Sample2/Thor-attributes-Sample2.zip`
4. Delete the zip files.
5. Run the experiments from the **Eclipse IDE** or  console. The experiments are described below:
   - `edu.isistan.fmframework.evaluation.Experiment_1.java`: this experiment evaluates the response time and optimality degree of the CSA algorithm variants using randomly generated features models.
   - `edu.isistan.fmframework.evaluation.Experiment_2.java`: this experiment evaluates the response time, optimality degree, and completeness of the CSA approximate variants with other approximate approaches. It uses real models from the [SPLOT repository](http://www.splot-research.org/).
   - `edu.isistan.fmframework.evaluation.Experiment_3.java`: this experiment evaluates the response time of the CSA exact variants with other exact approaches. It uses real models from the [SPLOT repository](http://www.splot-research.org/).
   - `edu.isistan.fmframework.evaluation.Experiment_4.java`: this experiment evaluates the response time and optimality degree of the CSA variants with problem instances that involves feature interactions. It uses real models from the [SPLOT repository](http://www.splot-research.org/), enriched with attributes generated by the [Thor tool](https://github.com/se-passau/thor-avm).
6. Output results are stored in **Results** subfolder.
